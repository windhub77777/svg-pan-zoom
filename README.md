svg-pan-zoom library
==========================

JavaScript library that enables panning and zooming of an SVG in an HTML document, including SVGs in HTML 'object' or 'embed' elements and in-line SVGs. The library responds to mouse events and offers hooks for custom, programmatic control of pan and zoom behavior.

Capabilities:
  * Pan with mouse events or custom JavaScript hooks
  * Zoom with mouse events (wheel or double-click) or custom JavaScript hooks
  * Element dragging with mouse events (custom JavaScript hooks not provided, but if you need them, check out [D3.js](http://d3js.org/))

Demos
-----
 Pan and zoom the SVG tiger on github pages:
 * [Single Inline SVG](http://ariutta.github.io/svg-pan-zoom/demo/inline.html)
 * [Multiple Inline SVGs](http://ariutta.github.io/svg-pan-zoom/demo/multi-instance.html)
 * [SVG Inserted with 'Embed' Element](http://ariutta.github.io/svg-pan-zoom/demo/embed.html)
 * [SVG Inserted with 'Object' Element](http://ariutta.github.io/svg-pan-zoom/demo/object.html)
 * [SVG Inserted with 'Img' Element](http://ariutta.github.io/svg-pan-zoom/demo/img.html) (These cannot be panned/zoomed.)

How To Use
----------

1) Ensure the target SVG has a top-level 'g' element with the id 'viewport' to enable zooming for the entire SVG:

```xml
<g id="viewport"></g>
```

If the target SVG does not have this element, the library will create it.

2) Reference the [svg-pan-zoom.js file](http://ariutta.github.io/svg-pan-zoom/svg-pan-zoom.js) and optionally the [control icons plugin file](http://ariutta.github.io/svg-pan-zoom/control-icons.js) from your HTML document. Then call the init method:

```js
svgPanZoom.init();
```

If you want to override the defaults, you can optionally specify one or more arguments:


```js
svgPanZoom.init({
  'selector': '#my-svg',
  'controlIconsEnabled': true,
  'panEnabled': true, 
  'zoomEnabled': true,
  'dragEnabled': false,
  'zoomScaleSensitivity': 0.2,
  'minZoom': 0.5,
  'maxZoom': 10,
  'onZoom': function(scale) { ... }  // Callback function when zoom changes.
});
```

If any arguments are specified, they must have the following value types:
* 'selector' must be a [CSS selector](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html). If left blank, svg-pan-zoom will look for the first SVG document in your HTML document.
* 'controlIconsEnabled' must be true or false. Default is false.
* 'panEnabled' must be true or false. Default is true.
* 'zoomEnabled' must be true or false. Default is true.
* 'dragEnabled' must be true or false. Default is false.
* 'zoomScaleSensitivity' must be a scalar. Default is 0.2.
* 'minZoom' must be a scalar. Default is 0.5.
* 'maxZoom' must be a scalar. Default is 10.
* 'onZoom' must be a callback function to be called when zoom changes.


To programmatically pan, call the pan method with a direction of 'up', 'down', 'right' or 'left'.

```js
svgPanZoom.pan([selector], direction); // selector is optional.
```

To programmatically zoom, you can use the zoom method to specify your desired scale value:

```js
svgPanZoom.zoom({
  'selector': '#my-svg', // selector is optional
  'scale': 2 // required. values must be scalar.
});
```

Or you can use the zoomIn or zoomOut methods:

```
svgPanZoom.zoomIn([selector]); // selector is optional

svgPanZoom.zoomOut([selector]); // selector is optional

svgPanZoom.resetZoom([selector]); // selector is optional.
```

If you want faster or slower zooming, you can override the default zoom increment with the setZoomScaleSensitivity method.

To programmatically enable/disable pan, zoom or drag:

```js
svgPanZoom.enablePan();
svgPanZoom.disablePan();

svgPanZoom.enableZoom();
svgPanZoom.disableZoom();

svgPanZoom.enableDrag();
svgPanZoom.disableDrag();
```

You can configure the default enabled/disabled state of pan/zoom/drag with the variables listed in the CONFIGURATION section of the file.

Known issues
------------
  * Zooming (while panning) on Safari might have some issues. See [Issue #15](https://github.com/ariutta/svg-pan-zoom/issues/15).
